# Multilingual Online Translator

## Objectives - `Stage 6/7`

At this stage, your program should:

1. Instead of all inputs, take command-line arguments. The first argument is
   the name of the source language, the second argument is the name of the
   target language, the third argument is the word. If the word should be
   translated to all languages, the second argument will be all.
2. The rest of the functionality should remain the same as in the previous
   stage.

You'll see some significant changes in the usability of the app!
