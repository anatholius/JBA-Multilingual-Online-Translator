# Multilingual Online Translator

## Objectives - `Stage 5/7`

Add the following functionality to your program:

1. Before taking an input specifying the target language, output the message
   Type the number of a language you want to translate to or '0' to translate
   to all languages:
2. If the user inputs 0 as the target language, translate the word to all
   available languages.
3. Output results to the terminal, as in the previous stage. At this stage,
   it's enough to print just one translation and one sentence pair per target
   language.
4. Save results of the search to a file named word.txt, where word is the word
   that was being translated.
